## 8th Semester Project

LANGUAGE, SPACE AND MIND

May 2016
    
- Explore the usage of Category Theory ( Haskell oriented ) to various Linguistics Models 
 
- We based this project on the exploratory grounds based on the book by Paul Chilton (2014) - Language, Space and Mind 

- Gained knowledge about modeling language parser in a strictly Functional programming environment such as Haskell

- Explored various approaches towards a more mathematically rigorous semantic/syntactic analysis approach to computational linguistics         

- The Result} of the entire analysis were a couple iPython notebooks with the NLTK analysis of about 20 languages and the current state of quality of parsers}

- Using this analysis we outline the major steps we need to take to create more Mathematically oriented parsers for syntactic analysis and modeling languages
